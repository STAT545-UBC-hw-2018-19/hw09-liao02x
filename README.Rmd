This repo is for STAT545 homework 09 makefile activity by Minzhi Liao.

The whole project is built by this (Makefile)[https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw09-liao02x/blob/master/Makefile].

For those who are interested, I also commit once when the whole project is built up. So if you want to see that, the link is here: (hw09-liao02x)[https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw09-liao02x].

The commit history of this repository reflects what a student might do as she works through [this activity](http://stat545-ubc.github.io/automation04_make-activity.html) from [STAT 545](http://stat545-ubc.github.io). This fully developed example shows:

  * How to run an R script non-interactively
  * How to use `make`
    - to record which files are inputs vs. intermediates vs. outputs
    - to capture how scripts and commands convert inputs to outputs
    - to re-run parts of an analysis that are out-of-date
  * The intersection of R and `make`, i.e. how to
    - run snippets of R code
    - run an entire R script
    - render an R Markdown document (or R script)
  * The interface between RStudio and `make`
  * How to use `make` from the shell
  * How Git facilitates the process of building a pipeline
